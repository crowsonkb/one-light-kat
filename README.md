## One Light Kat (Atom syntax theme)

Improved (IMO) version of [One Light](https://github.com/atom/one-light-syntax).

Changes from the original:

* Background is `#ffffff`.
* Text is fully monochrome (saturation 0%).
* Function calls are blue in Python (with [MagicPython](https://atom.io/packages/magicpython)).
* Operators are cyan.
* Comments and line numbers use light font weight (300).
* Keywords, types, and language-specific constants are semibold (weight 600).
* Function parameter names are italic (in many languages).
